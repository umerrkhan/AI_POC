"feedback":"I really tried to like Masterclass but I just couldn't get past the non-masters and non-class aspects of the content. Very dramatic and well produced but it's highly subjective talks clearly authorized by the woke gods of DEI. I can see some of this content being not only unhelpful but damaging to credulous viewers. Like the how to deal with AI at work starts off with a series of women telling me that I need to reimagine my relationship with work itself like WTF are you even talking about? Who the heck are you?? It's like Netflix but not entertaining. Then I saw the New Rules of Business with Kim Kardashian and I was just DONE. Unlike all the one star reviews I was able to refund easily so that's not a problem for me. You just need to use their chatbot"
